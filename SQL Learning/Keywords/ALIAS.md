### **Explanation:**
Aliases are used to give a table or a column a temporary name. They are often used to make column names more readable.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
SELECT first_name AS fname, last_name AS lname
FROM employees;
```

### **Use Case:**
Simplifying or clarifying column names in the result set.

---

## **8. IN**

### **Explanation:**
The `IN` keyword allows you to specify multiple values in a `WHERE` clause.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column IN (value1, value2, ...);
```

### **Example:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing');
```

### **Use Case:**
Filtering records to include only those that belong to specified departments.

---

## **9. BETWEEN**

### **Explanation:**
The `BETWEEN` keyword is used to filter the result set within a certain range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
```

### **Use Case:**
Fetching employees hired within a specific date range.

---

## **10. LIKE**

### **Explanation:**
The `LIKE` keyword is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column LIKE pattern;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';
```

### **Use Case:**
Finding employees whose first name starts with the letter 'J'.

---

## **11. IS NULL / IS NOT NULL**

### **Explanation:**
These keywords are used to check for NULL values in a column.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column IS NULL;

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NULL;
```

### **Use Case:**
Fetching employees who do not have an assigned department.

---

## **12. CASE**

### **Explanation:**
The `CASE` statement is used to create conditional logic in SQL queries, similar to `IF-THEN-ELSE` statements in programming.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1,
       CASE
           WHEN condition1 THEN result1
           WHEN condition2 THEN result2
           ELSE result3
       END AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name,
       CASE
           WHEN department = 'Sales' THEN 'Sales Department'
           WHEN department = 'Marketing' THEN 'Marketing Department'
           ELSE 'Other Department'
       END AS department_name
FROM employees;
```

### **Use Case:**
Creating custom labels based on department values.

---

## **13. JOINS (Advanced)**
- **Explanation:** Beyond basic joins, understanding advanced joins like self joins and cross joins can be beneficial.

### **Self Join:**
Used to join a table with itself.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM table_name a, table_name b
WHERE a.common_column = b.common_column;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
SELECT e1.first_name AS 'Employee', e2.first_name AS 'Manager'
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

### **Use Case:**
Finding the manager for each employee within the same employees table.

### **Cross Join:**
Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, p.project_name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN projects p;
```

### **Use Case:**
Generating all possible combinations of employees and projects.

---

## **14. SUBQUERIES**

### **Explanation:**
A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It can be used in various clauses like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column = (SELECT column FROM another_table WHERE condition);
```

### **Example:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```

### **Use Case:**
Fetching employees who belong to the 'Sales' department by using a subquery to get the department ID.

---

## **15. INDEXES**

### **Explanation:**
Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of data from a database table by creating a data structure that allows for faster searching.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```

### **Example:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department
ON employees (department);
```

### **Use Case:**
Improving the performance of queries that filter by the `department` column.

---

## **16. AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS**

### **Explanation:**
Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT aggregate_function(column)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

### **Use Case:**
Calculating the average salary of employees in the Sales department.

---

## **17. TRANSACTIONS**

### **Explanation:**
Transactions are used to execute a sequence of SQL statements as a single unit of work. They ensure data integrity by allowing commit and rollback operations.

### **Syntax:**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- SQL statements
COMMIT;
-- or
ROLLBACK;
```

### **Example:**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.10 WHERE department = 'Sales';
DELETE FROM employees WHERE hire_date < '2000-01-01';
COMMIT;
```

### **Use Case:**
Ensuring that either all salary updates and deletions are executed successfully or none of them are, maintaining data consistency.
